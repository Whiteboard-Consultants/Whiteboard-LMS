## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### What's Working Well ✅
- Core functionality is complete and tested
- Architecture is solid and maintainable
- Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- Database design is good with RLS policies
- TypeScript provides strong type safety

### What Needs Attention ⚠️
- Security credentials must be rotated and secured
- Debug logging needs to be managed for production
- Configuration must be environment-specific
- Production build must be verified
- Deployment infrastructure needs setup
- Monitoring and observability needed

### Critical Actions Required 🚨
1. **TODAY**: Rotate all API keys (4-6 hours)
2. **TOMORROW**: Remove debug logging (8-12 hours)
3. **THIS WEEK**: Verify production build (2-4 hours)
4. **BEFORE LAUNCH**: Execute all remaining tasks per plan

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit credentials to git
- Use platform-managed secrets (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Rotate credentials quarterly
- Use environment-specific keys (test vs production)
- Enable git-secrets hook: `git secrets --install`

### Deployment Best Practices
- Test production build locally before deploying
- Use staging environment for final testing
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor error tracking actively for first week
- Document all production procedures

### Development Sustainability
- Use the new `logger.ts` for all future logging
- Wrap non-critical logs with environment checks
- Create runbooks for common issues
- Set up regular dependency updates
- Schedule security audits quarterly
