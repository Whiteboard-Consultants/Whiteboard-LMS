## What's Left ⏳

### STEP 4: Disable OLD Legacy Keys (5 minutes) - CRITICAL!

**This is the security-critical step. Do NOT skip.**

1. **Open**: https://app.supabase.com
2. **Select**: WhitedgeLMS project
3. **Navigate**: Settings → API → **Legacy API Keys** tab
4. **Find**: Your OLD Anon Key (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...`)
   - Click the disable/trash button
   - Confirm "Yes, I want to disable this key"
   - Wait for confirmation (should show "Disabled")
5. **Find**: Your OLD Service Role Key (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...`)
   - Click the disable/trash button
   - Confirm "Yes, I want to disable this key"
   - Wait for confirmation (should show "Disabled")

**Result**: Both old keys are now permanently disabled and useless. Even if anyone has them, they can't access your database anymore.

### STEP 5: Final Testing (5-10 minutes)

Once old keys are disabled:

1. **Refresh**: http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **Test Signup**:
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Enter a test email (e.g., test@example.com)
   - Set a password
   - Click Sign Up
   - Expected: Account created successfully
3. **Test Login**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Enter the test email
   - Enter the password
   - Click Login
   - Expected: You log in successfully and see the dashboard
4. **Verify**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Console
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Should be NONE related to "Unauthorized" or "JWT"

**Result**: If signup and login work without errors, Task 1.1 is 100% complete!

---

## How to Know You're Done ✅

When all of these are TRUE, Task 1.1 is COMPLETE:

- ✅ Old Anon Key is DISABLED in Supabase
- ✅ Old Service Role Key is DISABLED in Supabase
- ✅ New Publishable Key is ACTIVE in Supabase
- ✅ New Secret Key is ACTIVE in Supabase
- ✅ .env.local has new keys
- ✅ Dev server is running
- ✅ Signup works
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ No errors in console

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### ❌ Old keys don't show a disable option
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the **Legacy API Keys** tab (not "API Keys")

### ❌ Signup/login still failing after disabling
**Solution**: 
- Hard refresh page: `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac
- Check .env.local has new keys
- Restart dev server: `pkill -f "next dev" && npm run dev`

### ❌ "Unauthorized" error still appearing
**Solution**:
- Verify both old keys are DISABLED (not just deleted)
- Check new keys are in .env.local
- Clear browser cache: DevTools → Application → Clear Site Data

## Quick Summary

**You're almost done!** Just need to:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard

3. Test signup/login on your app
4. Report completion

**Time needed**: 10-15 minutes max
