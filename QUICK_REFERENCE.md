## Verification Checklist

After creating a course:

- [ ] Console shows all ✅ logs
- [ ] Redirected to edit page
- [ ] Success message appears
- [ ] Can query database: `SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id = '[courseId]'`
- [ ] All fields populated in database
- [ ] Image URL is valid and starts with `https://...supabase.co/storage/...`
- [ ] Image visible in Supabase Storage bucket
- [ ] Course appears in instructor dashboard
- [ ] Can edit course again and verify changes persist

---

## Common Issues

**"You must be logged in"**
→ Refresh page and log in again

**Image upload fails but course created**
→ This is OK! Image is optional. Course created without it.

**Course doesn't appear in dashboard**
→ Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
→ Check you're logged in as the right user

**Rich text formatting lost**
→ Check database - should still have HTML tags
→ Display layer might need HTML renderer

---

## Performance

- Form submission: 1-5 seconds (including image upload)
- Image upload: 500-2000ms
- Database insert: 500-1500ms
- Total: Usually completes in 3-5 seconds

Image upload times out after 30 seconds (won't block course creation).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the form** using quick test above
2. **Review logs** in browser console
3. **Verify database** using SQL query
4. **Check storage** in Supabase dashboard
5. **Confirm dashboard** shows new course
6. **Run error tests** with invalid inputs
7. **Ready for production!** ✅

## Need Help?

Check the console logs first:
- F12 → Console tab
- Look for ❌ or ⚠️ symbols
- Read error messages carefully

If logs don't help:
1. Check `COURSE_FORM_FLAWLESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed test cases
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Supabase dashboard for connection issues
4. Verify user has correct role (instructor/admin)
