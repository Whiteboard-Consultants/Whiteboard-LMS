# Featured Image Management - Complete Implementation Summary ✅

## What Was Built

A comprehensive featured image management system for blog posts with the following capabilities:

### 1. **Correct Bucket Routing** ✅
- Featured images → `uploads` bucket (consistent with existing system)
- Editor content images → `course-assets/blog_images` bucket
- Query parameter-based routing: `?bucket=featured` and `?bucket=editor`

### 2. **Image Deletion Feature** ✅
- Prominent **"Delete Image"** button in featured image preview
- **"Replace Image"** button for quick image updates
- Confirmation toast messages for user feedback
- Proper database null handling for deleted images

### 3. **Improved User Experience** ✅
- Both action buttons visible below image preview
- Clear visual hierarchy and labeling
- Confirmation feedback on all actions
- Easy workflow for add/replace/delete operations

## How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
1. Admin clicks "Upload File" in Featured Image section
2. Selects image and uploads
3. Endpoint receives ?bucket=featured parameter
4. Image uploads to 'uploads' bucket with timestamp naming
5. Public URL returned and set in form field
6. Image preview appears with Delete/Replace buttons
7. Admin saves blog post
8. Image URL saved to database and displays on blog page
```

### Delete Flow
```
1. Admin clicks "Delete Image" button
2. Image cleared from form field
3. Toast confirmation: "Image Removed"
4. Admin clicks "Save Post" to apply changes
5. Database updated with NULL for featured_image fields
6. Image no longer displays on blog page
```

### Replace Flow
```
1. Admin clicks "Replace Image" button
2. Upload tab automatically switches
3. Selects new image
4. Old image cleared, new preview appears
5. Saves post
6. New image displays, old reference removed from database
```

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

#### 1. `/src/app/api/upload-image/route.ts`
**Changes**: Added bucket routing logic
```typescript
// Accepts ?bucket=featured or ?bucket=editor query parameter
// Routes to different buckets and folders based on parameter
- Featured images → uploads/ with timestamp naming
- Editor images → course-assets/blog_images/ with UUID naming
```

#### 2. `/src/components/ui/image-upload.tsx`
**Changes**: Enhanced UI with delete/replace functionality
```typescript
// Added after image upload:
- Delete Image button (red, destructive variant)
- Replace Image button (outline, switches to upload tab)
- Both buttons always visible below preview
- Confirmation toast on delete
- Button disabled state support
```

#### 3. `/src/components/rich-text-editor.tsx`
**Changes**: Added editor-specific bucket parameter
```typescript
// Rich text editor images now specify ?bucket=editor
// Ensures correct routing to course-assets bucket
```

#### 4. `/src/app/(main)/admin/blog/actions.ts`
**Changes**: Allow null values for featured images
```typescript
// createPost: featured_image set to URL or null
// updatePost: featured_image set to URL or null
// Both columns updated: featured_image and featured_image_url
// Allows proper deletion by setting to NULL
```

## Database Structure

### Featured Image Columns
- `featured_image`: VARCHAR, stores full public URL or NULL
- `featured_image_url`: VARCHAR, stores full public URL or NULL

### Deletion Behavior
When image is deleted:
```sql
UPDATE posts SET 
  featured_image = NULL,
  featured_image_url = NULL
WHERE id = '...';
```

## Storage Configuration

| Type | Bucket | Path | Filename | Status |
|------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Featured Images | `uploads` | Root | `{timestamp}-{original-name}` | ✅ Active |
| Editor Images | `course-assets` | `blog_images/` | `{timestamp}-{original-name}` | ✅ Active |
| Legacy Images | `uploads` | Various | Old naming | ✅ Compatible |

Both buckets have public read access enabled ✅

## User Workflow

### Creating a Blog Post
```
1. Fill in title, excerpt, content, category
2. Upload featured image (NEW: goes to uploads bucket)
3. See preview with Delete/Replace options
4. Save post
✅ Featured image displays as hero image on blog page
```

### Editing a Blog Post
```
1. Click Edit on existing blog post
2. Option A: Delete old image, upload new one
   - Click "Delete Image"
   - Upload new image
   - Save post

2. Option B: Replace directly

2. Click "Delete Image"
3. See confirmation toast
4. Save post
✅ Blog post now displays without featured image
   (Shows placeholder in listing)
```
