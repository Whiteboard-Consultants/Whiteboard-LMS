## 🔄 **Important Notice: Fresh Supabase Project Migration**

### **Issue with Login Credentials**

The "Invalid login credentials" error is occurring because we recently migrated to a **clean new Supabase project**. This means:

### **📋 What Happened:**
- ✅ We successfully moved to a new, clean Supabase project
- ✅ Registration and email verification now work perfectly
- ⚠️  **Previous user accounts** from the old project don't exist in the new one

### **🔧 Solution for Users:**

**If you had an account before today:**
1. **Re-register** with the same email address
2. **Confirm your email** when you receive the verification message
3. **Sign in** with your new credentials

**If you're a new user:**
1. **Register** normally 
2. **Check your email** and click the confirmation link
3. **Sign in** after email confirmation

### **🎯 Current Status:**
- ✅ **Registration**: Working perfectly
- ✅ **Email verification**: Working perfectly  
- ✅ **Database**: Clean and properly configured
- ✅ **Authentication flow**: Fully functional

The migration eliminated all the previous 500 errors and database issues. Users just need to re-register once on the new system.

### **📧 Admin Notes:**
- Previous user data is **not** migrated (clean slate approach)
- All new registrations work seamlessly
- Email confirmation is required before login
- Consider sending a migration notice to existing users
