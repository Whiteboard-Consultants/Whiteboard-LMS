# Featured Image Delete Button - Visibility Fix ✅

## Problem

The Delete and Replace buttons were not visible or easily noticeable to users editing blog posts.

## Solution

Enhanced the ImageUpload component with a prominently styled container that makes the buttons immediately visible and actionable.

## Before vs After

### BEFORE
```
Featured Image section:
├─ Small "✅ Image selected successfully!" message
└─ Image preview (small, minimal styling)
   └─ Replace Image | Delete Image (buttons - hard to see)
   └─ Upload/URL tabs below
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Success message easy to miss
- ❌ Buttons small (sm size)
- ❌ No visual hierarchy
- ❌ Minimal styling/contrast
- ❌ Easy for users to overlook

### AFTER
```
Featured Image section:
├─ Current Featured Image (header)
├─ [Uploaded] (status badge - blue)
├─ Image preview (larger, clear border)
├─ [Upload Replace Image] [Delete Image] (full-width buttons with icons)
├─ 💡 Tip: Use "Replace Image"... (helpful guidance)
└─ Upload/URL tabs below
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Clear titled container with blue gradient background
- ✅ Status badge showing "Uploaded"
- ✅ Full-width prominent buttons (not small)
- ✅ Icons added to buttons (Upload, X)
- ✅ Helpful tip box with guidance
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Impossible to miss!
