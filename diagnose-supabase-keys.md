# üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Supabase Key Status Investigation

## ‚ùå CRITICAL FINDING

The error **"Legacy API keys are disabled"** means Supabase is REJECTING the authentication attempt because:

1. The key being used is recognized as a "legacy" key, OR
2. The new key you provided is not properly ENABLED in Supabase

## üîß IMMEDIATE TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Key Status in Supabase Dashboard

**IMPORTANT: Do this RIGHT NOW in your browser**

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project (lqezaljvpiycbeakndby)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Look at the **Project API Keys** section

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ One **Publishable Key** (starts with `sb_public_` or `sb_publishable_`) - **ENABLED** (toggle ON)
- ‚úÖ One **Secret Key** (starts with `sb_secret_`) - **ENABLED** (toggle ON)
- ‚ùå OLD legacy keys - **DISABLED** (toggle OFF or grayed out)

### Step 2: Check the Current Key in .env.local

Current value in .env.local:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_Duv2J_lUs2OQSALg9Z4KTg_d7N20D-j
```

**Question: Is this key showing as ENABLED or DISABLED in Supabase?**

### Step 3: If the Key is DISABLED

**This is the problem!** The new key was created but not enabled.

**Solution:**
1. In Supabase Settings ‚Üí API
2. Find the key `sb_publishable_Duv2J_lUs2OQSALg9Z4KTg_d7N20D-j`
3. Toggle it to **ENABLED** (move the toggle switch to the right/ON position)
4. SCREENSHOT the enabled state
5. Wait 10 seconds for changes to propagate
6. Refresh the app at http://localhost:3000
7. Try registration again

### Step 4: If STILL Not Working

**Possible causes:**
1. The key format is wrong (should start with `sb_publishable_` or `sb_public_`)
2. The URL is wrong (double-check it's `https://lqezaljvpiycbeakndby.supabase.co`)
3. Both keys need to be ENABLED, not just one
4. Browser localStorage still has old cached tokens

**Clear browser cache:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Storage section ‚Üí LocalStorage ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
4. Delete ALL entries
5. Refresh the page
6. Try registration again

## üìã SUPABASE KEY FORMAT REFERENCE

| Key Type | Format | Location | Visibility |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Publishable Key | `sb_publishable_*` or `sb_public_*` | Public (safe for browser) | CAN be shared |
| Secret Key | `sb_secret_*` or `sb_service_*` | Backend only | NEVER share |
| Legacy Anon Key | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJp...` | (JWT format) | DEPRECATED |
| Legacy Service Role | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJp...` | (JWT format) | DEPRECATED |

## üéØ NEXT ACTION FOR USER

1. **IMMEDIATELY**: Go to Supabase Dashboard and check if the publishable key is ENABLED
2. **If DISABLED**: Enable it now
3. **THEN**: Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. **TEST**: Try registration again at http://localhost:3000
5. **REPORT**: Did it work or still getting the error?

## üí° WHY THIS HAPPENED

When you create new API keys in Supabase:
- They're created in a valid state
- But might need explicit ENABLE if they're restricted keys
- The disable "Legacy API keys" setting disables ALL old JWT-format keys
- New modern keys (with `sb_` prefix) are treated separately

**The key you provided looks correct in format**, but it may not be ENABLED in Supabase yet.
