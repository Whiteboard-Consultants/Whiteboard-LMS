})
```

#### 3.3 JavaScript Bundle Size

## 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues to Address

### HIGH PRIORITY (Implement within 1 week)

#### Issue 1: Missing Course Schema
**Impact:** Courses won't appear in Google course results
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Add to all course pages
const courseSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "name": course.title,
  "description": course.description,
  "image": course.image,
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Whiteboard Consultants",
    "sameAs": "https://www.whiteboardconsultant.com"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": course.rating,
    "ratingCount": course.reviewCount
  },
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": course.price,
    "priceCurrency": "INR"
  }
}
```

#### Issue 2: Blog Posts Missing Article Schema
**Impact:** Blog won't rank for featured snippets
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Add to all blog posts
const articleSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": post.title,
  "description": post.excerpt,
  "image": post.image,
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": post.author
  },
  "datePublished": post.publishedAt,
  "dateModified": post.updatedAt,
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Whiteboard Consultants",
    "logo": "https://www.whiteboardconsultant.com/logo.png"
  }
}
```

#### Issue 3: Blog Title Not SEO Optimized
**Current:** "Blog | Whiteboard Consultants"
**Recommended:** "Education Blog | Study Abroad, Test Prep & Career Tips | Whiteboard Consultants"

#### Issue 4: No FAQ Schema on FAQ Pages
**Impact:** Reduced visibility in search results
**Fix:** Create `/faqs` page with comprehensive FAQ schema

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Implement within 2-3 weeks)

#### Issue 5: Dynamic Meta Tags for Blog Posts
**Current:** Generic metadata for all blog posts
**Fix:** Each blog post should have unique title, description, image

#### Issue 6: No Breadcrumb Schema
**Impact:** Breadcrumbs won't appear in SERP
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Add to all non-homepage pages
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://www.whiteboardconsultant.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Courses",
