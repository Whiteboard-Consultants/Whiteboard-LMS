-- IMMEDIATE FIX: Disable RLS temporarily to resolve infinite recursion
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor right now

ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.carts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.announcements DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

SELECT 'RLS disabled - infinite recursion fixed' as result;

-- Note: This temporarily removes security restrictions
-- We'll implement proper RLS policies later without the recursion issue
