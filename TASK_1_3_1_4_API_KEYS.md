## Important Notes

### Gemini API

- Multiple projects might have different API keys
- Make sure you're in the right Google Cloud project
- Check "Quotas & Analytics" to see API usage
- Set daily quotas to prevent runaway charges

### Gmail App Password

- **Not your Gmail password** - this is a special app-specific password
- Each app can have its own password
- Can be revoked independently without affecting Gmail login
- Required because Gmail has 2FA enabled

---

## Troubleshooting

### Gemini API

**‚ùå "Invalid API key" error**
- Solution: Copy key again, no extra spaces
- Stop/restart dev server

**‚ùå "API not enabled" error**
- Solution: Go to Google Cloud Console, enable "Generative Language API"

### Gmail App Password

**‚ùå "Invalid credentials" when sending email**
- Solution: Verify you used app password, not Gmail password
- Verify no leading/trailing spaces
- Verify 2FA is enabled

**‚ùå "Cannot access app passwords page"**
- Solution: Enable 2-Step Verification first
- Try in incognito window
- Check your Google Account has proper permissions
