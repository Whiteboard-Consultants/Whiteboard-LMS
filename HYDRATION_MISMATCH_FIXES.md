# Hydration Mismatch Fixes - October 24, 2025

## Problem

React was throwing hydration mismatch errors when the application mounted:

```
Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client.
```

Additionally, there was a chunk loading error for auth-nav component.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in how responsive UI components (mobile/desktop navigation) were being rendered:

1. **use-mobile hook** (`src/hooks/use-mobile.ts`):
   - Initializes `isMounted` as `false` during SSR
   - Only sets it to `true` after component hydration
   - This creates a mismatch: server renders one thing, client renders another

2. **MainNav component** (`src/components/main-nav.tsx`):
   - Used `useSidebar()` which returns `isMobile` state
   - Returned `null` during SSR when `isClient` was false
   - After hydration, would render either mobile or desktop version
   - This caused HTML structure mismatch between server and client

3. **MobileSidebar component** (`src/components/public-header.tsx`):
   - Checked `!isMounted || !isMobile` and returned `null`
   - During SSR: both were false, so returned null
   - After hydration: could render sidebar if isMobile was true
   - Server HTML != Client HTML = hydration error

## Solution

### 1. Fixed MobileSidebar in public-header.tsx

```typescript
function MobileSidebar() {
    const { isMounted, isMobile } = useSidebar();

    // Return placeholder during SSR to maintain consistent DOM structure
    if (!isMounted) {
        return <div className="flex items-center gap-2 lg:hidden" />;
    }

    if (!isMobile) {
        return null;
    }

    return (/* ... rest of component ... */);
}
```

**Why this works**:
- During SSR: Renders an empty div with same classes (consistent with client)
- After hydration: If not mounted, still shows the div
- Only removes/modifies after `isMounted` becomes true on client
- Prevents structural mismatch

### 2. Fixed MainNav in main-nav.tsx

```typescript
export function MainNav() {
  const { isMobile, isMounted } = useSidebar();
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  // During SSR and before hydration, render desktop version
  const shouldRenderMobile = isClient && isMounted && isMobile;
  
  if (shouldRenderMobile) {
    return <Accordion>/* Mobile nav */</Accordion>;
  }
  
  return <NavigationMenu>/* Desktop nav */</NavigationMenu>;
}
```

**Why this works**:
- During SSR: `isClient = false`, so `shouldRenderMobile = false`
- Always renders desktop version on server
- Client hydrates with same desktop structure
- After hydration: If screen is mobile, switches to mobile version
- Server and client structures match until hydration completes

## Key Principle

**Never return different React elements (or null) based on client-side conditions that aren't set on the server.**

Good ‚ùå:
```typescript
if (!isMounted) return null;  // Server = null, Client = component
```

Better ‚úÖ:
```typescript
if (!isMounted) return <Placeholder />;  // Server = placeholder, Client = placeholder
// Then after isMounted, switch to real content
```

Best ‚úÖ‚úÖ:
```typescript
// Render default (desktop) on server, switch to mobile only after hydration
const shouldRenderMobile = isClient && isMounted && isMobile;
if (shouldRenderMobile) return <Mobile />;
return <Desktop />;
```

## Commits

- `c0ea83c8` - üîß fix: Resolve hydration mismatch errors in navigation components

## Testing

After these changes:
- ‚úÖ No more hydration mismatch errors
- ‚úÖ Navigation renders consistently on server and client
- ‚úÖ Mobile/desktop switch works correctly after hydration
- ‚úÖ No console errors related to React hydration

## Related Issues

These fixes also address:
- "Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client"
- "Loading chunk failed" errors (which were cascading from hydration errors)

## Next Steps

If you still see hydration errors:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Look at network tab for failed chunk loads
3. Do a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Ensure dev server is running on correct port
