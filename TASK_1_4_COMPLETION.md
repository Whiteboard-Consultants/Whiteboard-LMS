## 🎯 Next Task: Task 1.5 - Git History Cleanup

Your repository still has OLD credentials in git history that need to be cleaned up:

**Why This Matters:**
- Even though old credentials are disabled in their respective services
- They shouldn't remain in git history
- Anyone with repo access could see them
- GitHub may still have them in forks/caches

**Next Action:**
1. Remove all credentials from git history
2. Verify .gitignore protects future commits
3. Ensure no sensitive data in repository
4. Confirm git history is clean

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
