# SMTP2GO Credentials Update Required

## Issue Found ✅

The screenshots show that SMTP2GO created **dedicated SMTP User credentials** that are different from the API key:

**Correct SMTP Credentials (from Screenshot 3):**
- **Username:** `whiteboardconsultant.com`
- **Password:** (Need to copy/reveal from dashboard)
- **SMTP Server:** `mail.smtp2go.com`
- **SMTP Port:** `2525`

**Current (Wrong) Configuration:**
```bash
SMTP_USER=api
SMTP_PASSWORD=api-3357F090449F44FEA4F52836661E500D
```

This is why authentication is failing - we were using the API key instead of the SMTP user credentials!

## Next Steps

**User Must Do (2 minutes):**

1. Go back to SMTP2GO dashboard → **SMTP Users**
2. Click on the SMTP user (showing username `whiteboardconsultant.com`)
3. Click the **eye icon** next to the password field to reveal the password
4. **Copy the password** and provide it to me

Once you provide the password, I will:
1. Update `.env.local` with correct SMTP user credentials
2. Restart the dev server
3. Test email sending immediately
4. Confirm Task 1.4 is complete ✅

## Why This Works

- **API Key** (`api-357F...`) = For REST API calls to SMTP2GO
- **SMTP User** (`whiteboardconsultant.com`) = For SMTP email sending
- They serve different purposes - we need the SMTP user for email!

The authentication error (535) makes sense now - SMTP2GO was rejecting the API key when we tried to use it as an SMTP password.
