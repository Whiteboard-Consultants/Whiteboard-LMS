# RTE Image Upload Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
When clicking the image button in the Rich Text Editor toolbar, the image upload functionality did not work. The issues were:

1. **Wrong API Endpoint**: The RTE was calling `/api/upload` which was designed for resume uploads (PDF/DOC/DOCX only)
2. **Button Not Triggering File Input**: The label element wasn't properly triggering the hidden file input
3. **Missing Authentication**: No access token was being passed to the upload endpoint
4. **No Image Validation**: The old endpoint couldn't handle various image formats

## Solution

### 1. Created New Dedicated Image Upload Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/upload-image/route.ts` ✨ NEW

Features:
- Accepts all common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
- Validates file type (images only, max 5MB)
- Uses user's access token for authentication
- Uploads to `blog_images/` folder in Supabase Storage
- Returns public URL immediately
- Comprehensive error logging

### 2. Fixed Rich Text Editor Component
**File:** `src/components/rich-text-editor.tsx`

**Changes:**

#### a. Added useAuth import
```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/use-auth';
```

#### b. Updated EditorToolbar to access auth
```tsx
const EditorToolbar = ({ editor }: { editor: Editor | null }) => {
  const { accessToken } = useAuth();
  const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  // ... rest of component
}
```

#### c. Updated handleImageUpload function
- Now uses `/api/upload-image` endpoint
- Passes access token via Authorization header
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Validates authentication before upload
- Better error messages

#### d. Fixed image upload button
Changed from `<label>` to proper `<button>`:
```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('🖱️ Image upload button clicked');
    fileInputRef.current?.click();
  }}
  disabled={isUploading}
  className={`p-2 rounded-lg ${isUploading ? 'cursor-not-allowed opacity-50' : 'hover:bg-accent'}`}
  aria-label="Add Image"
>
  {isUploading ? <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" /> : <ImageIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
</button>
```

## How It Works Now

### User Flow
1. Click image icon in RTE toolbar ✅
2. File dialog opens (images only) ✅
3. Select an image file ✅
4. Upload starts with spinner animation ✅
5. Image is sent to `/api/upload-image` with user's access token ✅
6. Image uploaded to Supabase Storage at `blog_images/[uuid].[ext]` ✅
7. Public URL returned immediately ✅
8. Image inserted into editor at cursor position ✅
9. Success toast notification shown ✅

### Technical Flow
```
User clicks image button
    ↓
Button triggers fileInputRef.click()
    ↓
File picker opens (accept="image/*")
    ↓
User selects image
    ↓
handleImageUpload is called
    ↓
Check if user is authenticated (accessToken available)
    ↓
Send to /api/upload-image with Bearer token
    ↓
Server validates file (type, size)
    ↓
Upload to Supabase Storage via REST API
    ↓
Return public URL
    ↓
Insert image in editor
    ↓
Show success toast
```

## Console Logging

The component now logs every step for debugging:
```
📤 Starting image upload: { name: 'photo.jpg', size: 2048, type: 'image/jpeg' }
🌐 Sending request to /api/upload-image
📥 Response received: status 200
✅ Image uploaded successfully: https://...public/blog_images/uuid.jpg
```

And on the server side:
```
📤 [IMAGE UPLOAD] Starting image upload
📁 File: { name: 'photo.jpg', size: 2048, type: 'image/jpeg' }
🌐 Uploading to Supabase: { url: '...', bucket: 'course-assets', folder: 'blog_images' }
📥 Upload completed in 1234ms with status 200
✅ Image uploaded successfully
🔗 Public URL: https://...public/blog_images/uuid.jpg
```

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing authentication token → "Please log in to upload images"
- Invalid file type → "Only JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and SVG are allowed"
- File too large → "File too large. Maximum size is 5MB"
- Upload failure → Specific HTTP status and error message
- Network timeout → 30-second timeout protection

## Testing Steps

1. Go to `/admin/blog/new` (create new blog)
2. Fill in blog title and content
3. In the RTE, click the image icon
4. Select an image file from your computer
5. Verify:
   - ✅ File picker opens
   - ✅ Loading spinner appears while uploading
   - ✅ Image appears in editor after upload
   - ✅ Success toast shows
   - ✅ Image has public URL
   - ✅ Image is visible in rendered blog

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `src/components/rich-text-editor.tsx` - Fixed image upload logic and button
2. ✨ `src/app/api/upload-image/route.ts` - New dedicated image upload endpoint

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND TESTED** - Image upload now works perfectly in RTE

## Production Readiness
- ✅ Proper authentication with access tokens
- ✅ File validation (type, size)
- ✅ Supabase Storage integration
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Security (requires login, token-based)
